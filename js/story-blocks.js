It\'s comming from the dark alley you just passed.</p><p>Do you stop and call out? Or walk a little faster?</p><div class='options'><button class='choice1'>Stop and call out</button><button class='choice2'>Walk faster</button></div></div>";

With your heart in your throat, you laugh a little at yuor self and keep walking toward the train. But before you reach the corner, you hear what sounds like footsteps behind you. You slow down, and the footsteps stop. You turn slowly around once more and we come face to face. I drag you into the alley with me. You don't get any more Haloweens.</p></div>";
